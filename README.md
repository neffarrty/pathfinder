## About the program
The program finds all the shortest paths between all the islands, using information
about the bridges that connect them. The program:
 * reads data from a file. Its name is specified as a command-line argument
 * finds all the shortest paths between each combination of two islands using *Floyd-Warshall algorithm*
 * prints the paths using the FIFO rule for the islands to the standard output

## Input file description:
 * the first line in the file is the number of islands
 * the remaining lines describe the distance between the two islands, one per line. Each line consists of two islands, the length of the bridge between them and a newline in a format: *island1-island2,length_of_bridge*:
 - the names of the islands contain only alphabetic characters and cannot be empty or identical
 - the length of the bridge contains only numbers, cannot be empty and has a positive value
 - the sum of the lengths of all bridges in the file does not exceed **INT_MAX**

## Example of input file
```
4
Greenland-Bananal,8
Fraser-Greenland,10
Bananal-Fraser,3
Java-Fraser,5
```


## Example of console output
